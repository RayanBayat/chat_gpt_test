- content: "To write a for loop in Dart, you can use the `for` keyword followed by\
    \ the loop variable, a condition, and an increment or decrement expression. Here's\
    \ the basic syntax:\n\n```dart\nfor (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)\
    \ {\n  // code to be executed in each iteration\n}\n```\n\nHere's an example of\
    \ a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n\
    \  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\n    print(i);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example,\
    \ `int i = 1` initializes the loop variable `i` to 1. `i <= 5` is the condition\
    \ that specifies when the loop should continue executing. `i++` is the increment\
    \ expression that increases the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nThe loop\
    \ will execute the code inside the curly braces `{}` for each value of `i` from\
    \ 1 to 5, printing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5."

    honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly
    edible. The reason behind this is that honey has low water content and acidic
    pH, which creates an inhospitable environment for bacteria and other microorganisms
    to grow. So, if stored properly, honey can essentially last forever!
